Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

If their was an assignment that I saw the power of function is the last assignment in CSE 110 that was
the moment when I was trying to figure out what was going on. Instead of figuring out the entire program
that I broke it down and found the issue there.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

The value of test function is to allow the porgrammer to test the function individually rather than the whole 
program but save them time and energy. Even with the test function that it should be taught beyond just CSE 111 but
even CSE 110 since this is something that they will be using for the rest of their life.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

My process for troubleshooting a program is to breakpoint that line and also run 
through the function line by line. Even so if it's not making any sense then to make
it better that I would throw it at AI and figure out what is going on.
